# music-room

A small room for friends to play music together. Users can enter the room and create and activate a playlist using YouTube videos. The playlists of the users in the room interlace into a queue which plays everyone's songs, with the idea being that you can find new music from your friends while also sharing your music with them. Uses a Node.js server together with front-end JavaScript and HTML. Hosted on Heroku.
